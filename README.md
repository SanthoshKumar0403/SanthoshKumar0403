## 🧠 Deep Dive: Heart Disease Prediction

A quick look at my approach to the **Heart Disease Prediction** project:

- ✅ Problem Type: **Binary Classification**
- 🧾 Data: Clinical features (e.g., age, BP, cholesterol, etc.)
- 🧮 Model: **Random Forest Classifier**
- 📏 Evaluation:
  - Used **10-Fold Cross-Validation** for robust generalization
  - Focused on **accuracy** and potential for **recall** improvement on positive (risky) cases
- 🎯 Outcome: Achieved **~82% accuracy**, demonstrating a solid baseline model for clinical decision support.

This project reflects my ability to:
- Handle end-to-end ML workflow
- Validate model performance beyond a single train-test split
- Communicate results in a **non-technical, business-relevant way**

---

## 📊 Highlight: Business-Focused Analytics

I enjoy not just building models, but also **answering questions like**:

- Which products drive **revenue vs. profit**?
- Which customer segment should we **target in the next campaign**?
- Where are we **losing margin** despite high sales?
- How can we make **dashboards that non-technical stakeholders love using**?

My dashboards and notebooks are designed to be:
- **Interactive**
- **Readable**
- **Directly linked to KPIs** (profit, retention, risk, efficiency)

---

## 📌 Current Focus

- 🔁 Building more **end-to-end case studies** (EDA → Model → Dashboard)
- 📈 Practicing **time-series and business forecasting**
- ☁️ Strengthening understanding of **cloud data tools** like BigQuery (conceptually)
